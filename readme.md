As digital technologies have radically transformed human life, this course tries to engage students in this digitally mediated and data-intensive geographic world, and also train them the timely technical skills which are demanding in emerging job markets. This course will provide a unique opportunity to explore emerging digital methods, to build a holistic solution to real-world problems, and to critically analyze their social implications. Rather than focusing exclusively on one or two specific topics, this course covers a full range of theoretical perspectives and practical exercises. The course begins with teaching students on geospatial project management using GitHub, and then a series of geospatial data operations and analyses are covered in detail, such as online data (e.g., geotagged tweets) acquisition, geocoding, spatial and placial analyses. With these preparations, this course switches to online geovisualization. After a brief introduction to web programming basics (e.g., JavaScript, Html, and CSS), students will learn how to visualize and narrate geographic phenomena in an online environment. A few state-of-the-art approaches and applications in digital geographies will be practiced, such as collecting aerial imagery and point clouds using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV, commonly known as drone) or LiDAR, as well as storing real-time data from an environmental sensor. Throughout, students will be empowered not only with defined skills that will be important to many emerging jobs, but also with critical intellectual vision. This course is very “hands-on” and interactive! Most of our time will be spent in a hybrid lecture/lab where students will be working together. Although there will be some individual written reflections and analyses, no formal written final exam will be set up. The final project enables students to work collaboratively to figure out a holistic solution to researching a real-world problem. With the completion of this course, each student can share the course work at a self-made website which can be publicly viewed by classmates, open-source community as well as future industrial recruiters. Along the way, the readings will include both applied and theoretical selections. Students will learn not only how people have been programming and visualizing, but also about how critical social theorists have identified assumptions, ideologies, and rigidities in existing practices that can help students to make effective, inclusive and empathetic decisions in today’s data-intensive geographic world.

## :flags: Learning Objectives

-   To identify when and how the methods, sociology, and objects of geographical inquiry can be transformed through computational and networked approaches.

-   To learn to find, evaluate, use, extend, and combine various methods and tools of digital geography as needed for a given task. Recently, examples of such tools have included: GitHub, QGIS, Python, JavaScript, and Mapbox.

-   To practice and reflect theoretically upon emerging born-digital, multi-modal, narrative, and interactive approaches to cartography and scholarly communication.

-   To reflect on the iterative and social dimensions to one’s own learning process.

## :bell: Course Requirement

**Student Tech Support:**

The Student Tech Loan Program is expanding as quickly as possible. We announced this to undergrads as soon as it hit the airwaves, in hopes some of them who need hardware can reserve for spring quarter. They expect new/additional machines to arrive in April. STLP Website: https://stlp.uw.edu/ (check the [Spring Announcement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qlbUBPdQFJt_jXS2fAOtORwNrBVtZqCb/view)).

**GitHub:** This course material will be hosted on GitHub instead of UW Canvas. On this dedicated GitHub repository, you can find most of the course material, participate in group discussions by submitting GitHub issues, and creating new GitHub repositories to turn in the lab deliverables. By the end of this quarter, you will be more proficient in operating a cloud-based coding environment and able to host your work online as a way to gain public and peer attentions.

**In-class discussion leadership:** You and your group mates will take at least  one in-class discussion. Please work together to prepare some activities and guiding questions that will inspire and structure our discussion of the material.

**Labs:** You need to finish all five labs by the due days. In order to help you work on each lab, we will walk through most of the labs in class.

**Participation in in-class discussion:** Complete all assigned readings and get familiar with the lab instructions before class meetings, and participating in critical discussions of those readings.

**Final Collaborative Project:** During the quarter, you will work with your group members to work on a collaborative project. During the final week, you will present your final project in class. The requriement for the final project will be published soon.

**Essay:** Each student will complete an essay that engages with the readings and the course themes, along with additional readings that you bring into conversation with the assigned course readings. You are aiming for 10 pages (double-spaced) coalescing around ideas and readings from this quarter. Writing projects is due no later than the end of **Week 10**.

## :two_men_holding_hands: Targeted Audience

This course targets students who have a background in fundamental geographic information science or equivalent computational or programming skills. This course is designed for students who are willing to learn defined GIS skills that will be important to many emerging jobs in location-based services, autonomous driving, web mapping, geographic data collection (using drone or LiDAR) and analyses. This course is also suitable for students who are interested in learning and critically reflecting upon cutting-edge geospatial techniques.

## :book: Copyright

Through this course, I would like to cultiviate the open source culture. The course materials are apprently open source for students and open source community to access.

Notably, **each student is not allow to videotape or audio-tape (record) my class in any form, and sharing recordings outside of class without the written consent of each student in the class is not permitted by [FERPA](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/ferpa/).** However, I will try to record most of the classes via Zoom and share them via Canvas. Even so, I still encourage each of you attending the lectures instead of watching the recorded videos afterwards. Your in-class participation is a key factor to yield the best learning outcome.

 instructor determines if their class can and cannot be recorded. This decision should be clearly communicated by the instructor at the beginning and throughout the quarter. In Zoom, the recording feature can be controlled by the instructor, as the meeting host.
